# RNAseq training materials

A collection of datasets and associated analysis workshop materials for teaching RNAseq.

Why?

I often teach RNAseq in environments with limited computational resources. I want to teach best practise, and at the same time I want the students to really experience each step of the analysis process. It turns out the vast majority of RNAseq studies are very poorly designed, and/or the data are very poorly described in the methods or in the deposit metadata. So having a record of the rare datasets meet all my requirements is useful.

What?

A collection of workshop materials, each one built around a particular dataset with high quality metadata, and data that can be analysed on commodity hardware.
