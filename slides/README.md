## RNA-seq slides

This directory contains slides that help explain or teach RNA-seq. Each slide is a markdown file (for use with [slidewinder](http://slidewinder.io)), and is also available as a rendered PDF.

Some of the slides are partly or completely derived from other people's slides. I've included attribution when this is the case.

All content created by me is under a CC-0 license - you can do whatever you want with it. If you'd like to credit me, great! If not, no problem, I would much rather the materials be easily useful than force people to credit me.
