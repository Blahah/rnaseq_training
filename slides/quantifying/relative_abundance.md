title: RNA-seq is a *relative* abundance assay
---

- RNA-seq gives you reads from the ends of a **sample** of fragments
- The size and exact composition of the sample are random (with some biases)
- Without additional data this only gives **relative abundance**
- More information is needed for absolute abundance - e.g. spike-ins
