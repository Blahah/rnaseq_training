title: RNA-seq overview
---

- Uses high-throughput sequencing (usually Illumina) - rapidly advancing
- Transcriptome equivalent to whole genome shotgun sequencing
- Key differences from genome sequencing:
  1. Transcripts present in different number of copies (expression levels)
  2. Often (not always) sequence is known and experiment is to measure expression
