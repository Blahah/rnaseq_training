title: What can you do with RNA-seq data?
---

### Assembly

**given** RNA-seq reads (and perhaps a genome sequence)

**produce** reconstructed transcript sequences

### Quantification

**given** RNA-seq reads and a set of transcript sequences

**produce** Relative abundance estimates for the transcripts

### Differential expression

**given** RNA-seq reads from multiple samples and a set of transcript sequences

**produce** Statistical estimates for whether any transcript has a different relative abundance between samples
