title: Measuring expression the old way - microarrays
tags: microarray, rnaseq, expression
---

- Each spot has a cluster of "probes" for a certain gene
- A **probe** is a DNA sequence that complements a specific known sequence
- Relies on complementary hybridisation
- Intensity or colour of light from each spot is proportional to number of matching molecules in the sample
- Requires prior knowledge of all target sequences
